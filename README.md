Big fan of bridging storytelling, data, abd visualization to make information simpler and more accessible.

Here's how it happened:

→ Graduated with BA in Sound Engineering
→ Worked as a promoter and booking agent in Berlin
→ Moved to Amsterdam to work at Netflix, fell in love with data-driven decision making
→ Learned SQL, Python, Tableau, and dashboard design by working on passion projects
→ Transitioned to data analyst and BI roles
